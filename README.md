## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Heroku

API flips a coin and stores 1 (for heads) and 0 (for tails). Async function is used (for practice, but not needed for program) to fetch 
JSON before client-side JS updates DOM - which includes starting the "flip" animations, and updating heads and tail counters on the client-side. Server is configured to deploy with Heroku

## Lessons Learned:
Learned how to create a server, load resources, and build a simple API with a read only function in node.js.
